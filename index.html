                <h2>What is Git?</h2>
                <p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots (commits) of your code base.
                    With the creation of each snapshot you build out a whole application, seeing the growth of a full app.
                    During this time you can make branches to experiement and come back to a previous snapshot you took or
                    merge those experiements into your app.</p>
                <h2>What is Github?</h2>
                <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together
                    on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during development.</p>

                    <h3>Git init</h3>
                    <p>Git init is the act of registering this current code base.</p>

                <div class="box1">
                    <h3>Git add</h3>
                    <p>Git add is how we stage the integration of our current code baase into our current list of snapshots</p>

                    <h3>Git status</h3>
                    <p>Git status allows us to see the changes we are going to make</p>

                <div class="box2">
                    <h3>Git commit</h3>
                    <p>Git commit; finally we can commit those changes we added to our last snapshot giving us a new snap of
                        our code with whatever new changes were made</p>

                <div class="box2">
                    <h3>Git remote add</h3>
                    <p>Git remote add is used to set up an online repository where we can place all of our current code. This
                        is where the outside world can see our code base.</p>

                    <h3>Git push</h3>
                    <p>Git push is how we get our code to Github, an excellent place to store all of our repositories. Other
                        developers might look at our existing projects to see how we approached problems, pull down our code
                        and add new features or even update our code base with features they wanted to add</p>
